# Machine-Learning-Beginner-Projects
In this repository, i'll create Machine learning projects only beginner level. 

Project 1: House_Price_Prediction
Description:
I demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to solve real-world regression problems. It provides a strong foundation in:
Regression concepts
Data preprocessing
Model training and evaluation
The project is suitable for beginners in Machine Learning and serves as a stepping stone toward more advanced models such as Ridge, Lasso, and ensemble techniques.

Project 2: Student Performance Prediction
Description:
Student Performance Prediction uses machine learning to predict a student’s final score based on factors like study hours, attendance, and previous grades.
It helps understand how different features impact academic performance using regression or classification models.
