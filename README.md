# Machine-Learning-Beginner-Projects
In this repository, i'll create Machine learning projects only beginner level to intermediate and intermediate to expert level. 

Project 1: House_Price_Prediction
Description:
I demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to solve real-world regression problems. It provides a strong foundation in:
Regression concepts
Data preprocessing
Model training and evaluation
The project is suitable for beginners in Machine Learning and serves as a stepping stone toward more advanced models such as Ridge, Lasso, and ensemble techniques.

Project 2: Student Performance Prediction
Description:
Student Performance Prediction uses machine learning to predict a student’s final score based on factors like study hours, attendance, and previous grades.
It helps understand how different features impact academic performance using regression or classification models.

Project 3: Loan Approval Prediction
Built a Loan Approval Prediction system using Logistic Regression to classify loan eligibility based on applicant income and loan amount.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification metrics.
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Project 4: Spam Email Detection
Built a Spam Email Detection system using Naive Bayes and Count Vectorization to classify messages as spam or non-spam.
Achieved reliable classification accuracy on sample text data.
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Project 5: Project_5_Customer_Purchase_Prediction_using_Logistic_Regression
Built a Logistic Regression model to predict customer purchase behavior using age and salary from an external dataset.
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Project 6: Project_6_Email_Spam_Detection_using_Naive_Bayes
Built an Email Spam Detection system using Naive Bayes and text vectorization on real-world email data.

Project 7: Customer Churn Prediction
A machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay.
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Project 8: Sales Prediction using Random Forest
Developed a Sales Prediction model using Random Forest with time-based feature engineering on real retail data.
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Project 9: Feature Engineering (with Sales Data)
Performed advanced feature engineering on retail sales data including time-based and business-driven features to improve model performance.
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Project 10: Feature_Engineering_with Mall_Custmers_Dataset
I used the Mall Customers dataset and focused on feature engineering. I created new features like age groups, income levels, spending behavior categories, and encoded categorical variables to make the data suitable for machine learning models.”
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Project 11: Feature_Engineering_with_Titanic_Survival_Prediction
This project transforms raw Titanic passenger data into meaningful predictors by creating new variables like Family Size and Social Title from names.
By grouping ages into categories and converting text into numbers (encoding), we make the data significantly easier for a machine learning model to process.
Ultimately, these engineered features reveal hidden patterns—like social status and family connections—that directly improve the model's ability to predict survival.
