# Machine-Learning-Beginner-Projects
In this repository, i'll create Machine learning projects only beginner level. 

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to solve real-world regression problems. It provides a strong foundation in:

Regression concepts

Data preprocessing

Model training and evaluation

The project is suitable for beginners in Machine Learning and serves as a stepping stone toward more advanced models such as Ridge, Lasso, and ensemble techniques.
